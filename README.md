# Lesser_Azevedo_2023
Scripts and dataframes for recreating analyses in Lesser, Azevedo, et. al., 2023

Also included is a pdf of the supplemental tables "Supplemental Tables 1-3.pdf", which feature links to the reconstructed neurons.

This repository can be used with or without access to the FANC materialization: 
* Without access, dataframes are included to run through scripts for recreating analyses and plots from Lesser, Azevedo et. al., 2023 
* With access, scripts are included for recreating dataframes, so that the analysis pipeline can be accessed in the future as the connectome proofreading progresses.
